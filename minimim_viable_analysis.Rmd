# Mimimum Viable Analysis of - Population tree construction and spatially-explicit admixture mapping

Generally not from a wheel, to bottom, to whole car... but from a skateboard, scooter, to bike, to car... each is a self-contained with instant gratification...
really big input data: 1. long time analysis 2. challenging to work with. 3. minimal possible dataset to approach the question.
