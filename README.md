# Phylogenetic Biology - Final Project

For the full project please see, "DahnYoung_Dong_Final" markdown and the knitted html/pdf (pdf document not formatted well so I recommend look at html or knit the final md yourself).
Markdown link is here https://github.com/Dahn-YoungDong/finalproject/blob/master/DahnYoung_Dong_Final.Rmd

*Dec 10th* 
Final Project write-up is done. Noted for the caveat in data interpretation due to small sample size.

*Dec 9th*
Start write the results and discussion based on comparing different K values.

*Dec 8th*
FinalProject Markdown finished. Deleted all intermediary files.

*Dec 7th*
Consolidating and finalizing all script into the finalproject markdown. When all transfer is done, the step-wise markdowns will be removed

*Dec 1st*
Look at "1.prep"" to make sense the data prepping code

*Nov 30th*
Finished prelim analysis. Produced an ancestry proportion graph, and a comparative plot of both spatially interpolated ancestry coefficients and population location mapped on elevation. 

I will no longer consider TreeMix for this project.

*Nov 24th:*
still figuring out the structure for minimal viability analysis. 

For population mapping- Closely following https://github.com/jdalapicolla/LanGen_pipeline_version2/blob/master/1.3_MAPS.R

And I decontructed the steps into three markdowns 1. filter , 2. structure, and 3. mapping

For TreeMix, I am still figuring out how to make it run over cluster with the large dataset. But since I switched to pilot dataset, I might try again with my laptop.
