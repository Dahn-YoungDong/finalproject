# Phylogenetic Biology - Final Project

DahnYoung_Dong_Final is a place holder. The main content is the three markdowns 1. prep , 2. filter, and 3. structure

*Dec 1st*
Look at "1.prep"" to make sense the data prepping code

*Nov 30th*
Finished prelim analysis. Produced an ancestry proportion graph, and a comparative plot of both spatially interpolated ancestry coefficients and population location mapped on elevation. 

*Nov 24th:*
still figuring out the structure for minimal viability analysis. 

For population mapping- Closely following https://github.com/jdalapicolla/LanGen_pipeline_version2/blob/master/1.3_MAPS.R

And I decontructed the steps into three markdowns 1. filter , 2. structure, and 3. mapping

For TreeMix, I am still figuring out how to make it run over cluster with the large dataset. But since I switched to pilot dataset, I might try again with my laptop.
